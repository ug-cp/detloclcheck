DetLocLCheck's documentation
============================

``DetLocLCheck`` is a software tool designed for the Detection and
Localization of Checkerboard calibration targets containing L-shape
markers. This tool utilizes template matching for initial detection,
followed by refinement using OpenCVâ€™s
`cornerSubPix <https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/dd/d1a/group__imgproc__feature.html#ga354e0d7c86d0d9da75de9b9701a9a87e>`__
function to achieve subpixel accuracy. Finally, world coordinates are
assigned to the detected markers.
